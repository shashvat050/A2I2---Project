### Normal/Gaussian Distribution

  -> is a bell shaped curve also known as Gaussian distribution is s a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that 
     data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean
     
     -> points to remember
     
        1) Normal distributions are symmetrical, but not all symmetrical distributions are normal.
        2) In a normal distribution the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1. It has zero skew and a kurtosis of 3.
        
        Note-> Standard Deviation - means how dispersed the data is in relation to the mean
               Kurtosis - means whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. 
                          heavy tailed meaning high kurtotsis or has outliers
                          light tailed meaning low kurtotsis or lack of outliers
                          outliers means an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population
                          
### Triangular Distribution 

  -> is a continuous probability distribution with a probability density function shaped like a triangle
    
    -> has three values namely 
        
        1) min - a
        2) max - b
        3) peak pt. - c
        
    -> Properties:
    
        1) Mean: (a + b + c) / 3
        2) Mode: c
        3) Variance: (a2 + b2 + c2 – ab – ac – bc) / 18

### Curve Fitting

  -> it means how we model or represent data spread by assigning a best fit function (curve) along the entire range. 
  
    -> Types of curve fitting:

        1) Interpolation: means where you discover a func. that is an exact fit to the data points. 
           Since it assumes no measurement error, it has limited applicability to real life scenarios.
           
        2) Smoothing: means when we find a func. that is an approximate fit to the data points, but we give room for error 
           & allow actual points to be near, but not necessarily on the line; given the error is minimized overall.
           
### Sampling

  -> it means to select of a subset of data from within a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population      
  
    -> Types og sampling:
      
        1) Biased: it means one or more parts of the population are favored over others. In this, we form forming a sample that favors 
                   certain values of study. A sample obtained from a biased sampling method is likely not representative of the entire 
                   population.
                   
        2) Unbiased: it means, each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected
    
   -> 3 types of unbiased sampling:
      
        1) Simple Random Sample: it means each items or set of members have equal chance of being included in sample
        
        2) Stratified Random Sample: it means items or population is divided into similar groups & then select a random from that group
        
        3) Systematic Random Sample: it means population members are put in some order, then a starting point is selected at 
                                     random & every n th member is selected to be in the sample.
